<p class="py-5">Rather than a long, manifesto-style pull quote, Rosalie's homepage features a short, abstract thought from chef/owner Chris Cosentino. The quote does provide some important information — establishing Rosalie as a "bubbling Italian restaurant" — but more than that, it adds a dash of whimsy to Rosalie's brand. It's a captivating description that makes users want to learn more, which they can do by clicking "About Us" for a longer description or coming in to experience the space firsthand.</p>
